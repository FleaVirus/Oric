# Oric Quantum Framework (OQF): Pure Technical Overview

This document gives a **comprehensive technical breakdown** of all current Oric functions, modules, and future add-on components, organized by category for clear developer reference.

## üèõÔ∏è Core System Architecture

* **Modular Layered Design**: Built as a multi-chapter system (Chapters 1‚Äì10), separating concerns across signal processing, risk logic, adaptive runtime, governance, and external integrations.
* **Dual-Brain Engine**: Combines deterministic logic (Fibonacci, technical analysis) with probabilistic intuition (sentiment, mood scoring, Lorentzian classifiers).
* **Thread-Safe Symbol Isolation**: Each symbol (asset) runs in its own process/thread with isolated runtime state, ensuring scalability and crash containment.
* **CCXT-Compatible Data Layer**: Universal exchange integration using CCXT for market data, order execution, and portfolio management.

## üì° Signal Processing & Strategy Layer

* **Signal Engine (Ch. 3 & 5)**

  * Multi-timeframe EMA, SMA, MACD, RSI, ADX analysis
  * Fibonacci harmonic alignment detection (e.g., 0.618/0.786 pivots)
  * Killzone awareness (Asia/EU/US sessions)
  * Institutional pattern overlays (QMLs, flags, liquidity sweeps)

* **Resonance & Mood Layer (Ch. 4 & 7)**

  * Solfeggio frequency alignment (528 Hz, 963 Hz overlays)
  * Resonance scoring based on signal harmony
  * Mood scoring engine calculating system risk appetite from ROI momentum

* **Semi-Question Glyph Logic (Future, Ch. 7.5)**

  * A pause/resolution engine to handle conflicting signals and shed low-resonance noise
  * Harmonizes probabilistic and deterministic outputs before decision

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Execution & Risk Control Layer

* **Adaptive Position Engine (Ch. 7)**

  * Dynamic position sizing, doubling, or scaling out based on volatility and signal confidence
  * SL (stop-loss), TP (take-profit), and TTP (trailing take-profit) logic

* **Risk Override System**

  * Aura buffers: protective zones that dynamically adjust risk parameters
  * 4D Scaling: exposure and margin recalculation across timeframes

* **Catch the Move Engine (Future)**

  * A high-volatility, momentum-surge capture system with adaptive leverage

---

## üåê External Integrations Layer

* **Webhook & API Gateway (Ch. 9)**

  * Flask-based webhook endpoint for TradingView signals
  * Planned RESTful API for external control and data access

* **Oracle Publishing Layer (Future, Ch. 10)**

  * Signed data feeds pushed on-chain for Qubic or other networks
  * Real-time momentum, risk, and sentiment scores published as oracle endpoints

* **SaaS Infrastructure (Future)**

  * Free/Pro/Enterprise tier management via smart contracts or API keys
  * Micro-fee logic for high-frequency or premium queries

---

## üß† AI & Sentience Layer

* **GPT-Sage Journaling (Ch. 10)**

  * Logs reasoning chains, trade annotations, and decision audits

* **RMSF (Real-Time Multimodal Sentiment Fusion, Future)**

  * Integrates social sentiment (Twitter, news) into signal processing

* **Oric.Observer (Future)**

  * Background agent monitoring market shifts, adapting risk parameters in real-time

* **Diagnostic Self-Reflection Module (Future)**

  * Internal health-check system analyzing system drift, performance decay, or parameter misalignment

---

## üï∏Ô∏è Visualization & UI Layer

* **SteamSynth Terminal UI (v3, Future)**

  * Single-page dashboard showing:

    * Live trade positions
    * Signal charts (Fibonacci overlays, mood heatmaps)
    * Real-time PnL and exposure meters
    * Interactive dials for strategy mode toggling

* **Likely Game Plan Projection (Future)**

  * Forward-looking projection engine visualizing most probable market paths

---

## üìä Analytics & Reporting Layer

* **On-Chain Performance Anchoring (Future)**

  * Anchors summary hashes of all trades and signals on blockchain for transparency

* **Self-Contained PnL Reporting**

  * Native logging of all trades, outcomes, ROI curves, and error rates

* **Backtesting & Simulation Engine (Planned)**

  * Historical replay and forward simulation tools to test strategy parameters

---

## üöÄ Future Add-On Modules (Under Design)

* **Oric.Aura Gate**: Quantum-like momentum threshold switch regulating major exposure transitions
* **Strategy Mandala Engine**: Cross-layer harmonization between LTF/MTF/HTF signals
* **AI-Enhanced Institutional Layer**: Automated identification of hedge fund-style patterns
* **AI Copilot (Oric.Copilot)**: Assistive layer providing human-readable recommendations, projected scenarios, and live optimizations
